# Web Based Accounting application #
## Motivation ##
Why am I trying to write an accounting application? Probably it is because I am more than a little bit masochistic. 
Actually, the reason for this project is for me to get a better understanding of how an accounting system, and by
extension, an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system works as well. 

Professionally, I am a web developer and report writer for a fairly large corporation. I have spent almost all of 
my time for the past year or so writing SQL scripts and building reports in Crystal Reports, SQL Server Reporting
Services, and Power BI. I need to keep my C# coding skills up to date, so here is this application. 

I'm also writing a Blog at the same time. you can find it at https://russelcodes.com/. 

## Installation / How to setup ##

Are you kidding? There are only two classes added to the project so far. Give me a few weeks and I'll add a controller
and some views. Once that is done, I'll add some more information on that.
